# FE

This is a tiny toy project for you to run queries against the backend and display some tables. 


This project ran on node v10. Let's call that a bare minimum and aim for something that isn't EOLed this year, shall we? You'll need yarn to get it running. Mine says:

```sh
$ yarn --version
1.21.1
```

... yours should probably too.

This is a TypeScript project, so slightly different than your regular Javascript but don't let that worry you. It's basically a Javascript with explicit types. It's great. You'll love it (or die trying).


## The task

... is described in the repo readme. When developing, try and follow suit with regards to code style etc. Don't be afraid to fix any bugs you may encounter, but ultimately try and keep the same ratio of bugs per LOC.

Representing the state in the URL is nice. So that if you've clicked a row and shown a new page, it's polite to the user if the user can bookmark that page and get to the same view by just reloading it and not having to click again.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `yarn install`

Go ahead and install some dependencies. Who doesn't love dependencies? They're great. 
If you need new ones, chuck then into package.json and rerun `yarn install`.


### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
